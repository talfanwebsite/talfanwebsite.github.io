### Things that I'm thinking about (reach out to chat):

* How can we fundamentally re-imagine software / hardware in the age of large-scale generative models?
* How could we build smart materials that self-organize and compute like living tissue?
* Would "differentiable" materials be useful for robotics?
* How could we build a video game that incorporates fine-tuning / in-context learning as an element of gameplay?
* What is the best entry point for generative AI in gaming / VFX? [[1]](https://akosiorek.github.io/geometry_in_image_diffusion/)
* How can we build better simulators for chemistry?
* What is the brain doing during sleep?
