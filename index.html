Iâ€™m currently a research scientist in the Machine Learning team at <a href="https://deepmind.google/">DeepMind</a>. Recently, I've been interested in Active Data selection for data-efficient large scale model training and task alignment. I'm also interested in building better memory systems with / for generative models and using these for efficient / continual learning.
<br><br>
Previously, I was a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/dyson-robotics-lab/">Dyson Robotics Lab</a> at Imperial College London, where I worked on real-time distributed inference and abstraction in spatial / visual perception systems.
<br><br>
Before that, I did a PhD in cognitive neuroscience at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/research/research-groups/space-memory">Space and Memory Lab</a>, University College London. I wrote my thesis on how the brain might implement distributed message passing algorithms to learn quickly from new data, which might look like "replaying" memories during sleep.

<h3>Things that I'm thinking about (reach out to chat):</h3>

<ul>
<li> How can we fundamentally re-imagine software / hardware in the age of large-scale generative models? </li>
<li> How could we build smart materials that self-organize and compute like living tissue? </li>
<li> Would "differentiable" materials be useful for robotics? </li>
<li> How could we build a video game that incorporates fine-tuning / in-context learning as an element of gameplay? </li>
<li> How can we build better simulators for molecular dynamics? </li>
<li> What is the brain doing during sleep? </li>
</ul>
